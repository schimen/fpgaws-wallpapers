This repository contains a script that downloads wallpapers for the FPGA WS on SSl. It also creates a slideshow for them which can be selected in the background settings.

### Adding wallpapers
To add wallpapers, a link to the new wallpaper image can be added to the [prepare_wallpapers.sh](./prepare_wallpapers.sh) script. It is also possible to simply copy the wallpaper to the images folder generated by the script.
To add the new wallpaper, the script must be run.

### Running the script
Before running the script, please make sure you are running Gnome, and you have wget installed.
to run the script, run the command:
```bash
bash prepare_wallpapers.sh
```
